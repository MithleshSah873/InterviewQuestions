# Cracking the Coding Interview Series - Linked List Problems

I have decided to solve the problems in the CTCI book. Every chapter will be a different project in the solution. 
This is the one on LinkedLists and I am hoping to tackle all the 7 linked list questions that can possibly be solved in C#.

## Duplicate Removal

Write a program to remove duplicate nodes from an unsorted linked list. 

Followup

How would you achieve this if a temporary buffer was not allowed?

Solutions in `LinkedList_1.cs`

## Value of kth to the last element

Implement an algorithm to find the k'th to the last element of a singly linked list. 

Solutions in `LinkedList_2.cs`

## Delete a node in the middle

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, give only acess to that node.

Solutions in `LinkedList_3.cs`
