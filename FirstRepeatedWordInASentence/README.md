# First Repeated Word

A sentence is a group of words. A word is a sequence of characters or letters `a-zA-Z`.
Words are delimited by spaces or non-leter characters like `',', ':', '-', '.', '\t'`.

A repeated word is when a word occurs more than once in a sentence provided the comparison is case sensitive. 
For example, `had != Had`.

Given a sentence as a string, find the first repeated word in the string.
