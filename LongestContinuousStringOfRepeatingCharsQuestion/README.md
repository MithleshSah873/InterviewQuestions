# Longest Uniform Substring

This question can be asked in many flavours

  * Given an input string, divide it into substrings where each substring contains the longest continuous string of the same character and output a string with the character for each substring and the length of the respective substring
 
Another question of the same type:

  *  Find the Longest Uniform Substring. A string of repetitive characters is called a uniform substring. Given an input string, return a tuple that contains the following: 
      * the start position of the longest sub-string of repetitive character in the input string
      * the longest sub-string of repetitive characters


    example would be:
    - input: geeksforgeeks
    - output: 1 ee

    - input: abbbbbaaafccccccccdd
    - output: 10, cccccccc
