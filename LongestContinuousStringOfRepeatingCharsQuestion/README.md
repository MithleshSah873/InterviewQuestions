Given an input string, divide it into substrings where each substring contains the 
longest continuous string of the same character and output a string with the character 
for each substring and the length of the respective substring
example: i think this is wrong below
if input is Malayalam
aaa
mm
ll
y
correct example would be:
- input: geeksforgeeks
- output: ee 2

- input: abbbbbaaafccccccccdd
- output:
bbbbb 5
aaa 3
cccccccc 8
dd 2
