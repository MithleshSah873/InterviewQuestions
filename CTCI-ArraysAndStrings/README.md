# Arrays and Strings

## Problem 1

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

## Problem 2

Implement a function `void reverse(char* str)` in `C` or `C++` which reverses a null-terminated string.

    CANNOT IMPLEMENT C CODE IN `C#`. Can do alternate C# solution. 

## Problem 3

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. In other words, if one is an anagram of another. 

## Problem 4

Write a method to replace all white-spaces in a string with `%20`. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters and that you are given the `true` length of the string.
    
    Please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.

##### Example:
    Input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
    Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"


## Problem 5

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of the repeated characters. If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original then your method should return the original string. You can assume that the string has only upper and lower case letters.

##### Example:

    Input: aabcccccaaa
    Output: a2b1c5a3
